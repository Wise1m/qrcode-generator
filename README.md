# qrcode-generator
This is a simple web application for generating QR codes using the Google Charts API. The app allows users to enter any text, URL, or other data that they want to encode as a QR code, and then generates a high-quality image of the QR code that can be saved, printed, or shared. Feel free to use and modify it as you wish.
